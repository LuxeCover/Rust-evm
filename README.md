# `sothis`

Sothis is a tool for replaying historical state on a local ***anvil/hardhat*** testnet node. 

## Usage

Sothis has optional arguments that are not listed in their respective mode sections that might prove useful. Please study the help section below. You can view it any time by running `sothis --help`.

```
Usage: sothis [OPTIONS] --source_rpc <source_rpc>...

Options:
  -s, --source_rpc <source_rpc>...
          HTTP JSON-RPC of the node we're querying data from
  -b, --terminal_block <terminal_block>...
          Block we're replaying until
  -r, --replay_rpc <replay_rpc>...
          HTTP JSON-RPC of the node we're replaying data to
  -m, --mode <mode>...
          Choose between live, historic replay, or tracking [default: historic]
      --exit_on_tx_fail [<exit_on_tx_fail>...]
          Exit the program if a transaction fails
  -t, --block_listen_time <block_listen_time>...
          Time in ms to check for new blocks. [default: 500]
      --entropy_threshold <entropy_threshold>...
          Set the percentage of failed transactions to trigger a warning [default: 0.07]
      --send_as_raw [<send_as_raw>...]
          Exit the program if a transaction fails
  -c, --contract_address <contract_address>...
          Address of the contract we're tracking storage.
  -l, --storage_slot <storage_slot>...
          Storage slot for the variable we're tracking
  -p, --path <path>...
          Path to file we're writing to [default: .]
  -f, --filename <filename>...
          Name of the file. [default: ]
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

Sothis currently has 3 modes. Live, historic and track.   

***IMPORTANT:*** Hardhat support is currently experimental. If you are using Hardhat, add the `--send_as_raw` argument.

### Historic

Historic mode is the default way to use sothis. Its used to replay state to a local node forked to a deep historical block.

#### Usage

- `-m historic`(optinal): Used to denote we are replaying in live mode.
- `--source_rpc`: RPC of the node we are getting blocks from.
- `--replay_rpc`: RPC of the node were sending blocks to.
- `--terminal_block`: Final block sothis will replay.

To stop replaying, terminate the process via Ctrl+C or however else you preffer.

```
sothis --source_rpc {ARCHIVE_NODE} --replay_rpc http://localhost:8545 -m historic --terminal_block 9000022
```

### Live

Live mode is designed to be used with a forked local node, with its tip near the head block. It replays the latest blocks as they come to your forked node.

#### Usage

- `-m live`: Used to denote we are replaying in live mode.
- `--source_rpc`: RPC of the node we are getting blocks from.
- `--replay_rpc`: RPC of the node were sending blocks to.

To stop replaying, terminate the process via Ctrl+C or however else you preffer.

```
sothis --source_rpc {ARCHIVE_NODE} --replay_rpc http://localhost:8545 -m live
```

### Track

The tracking mode is used to track the change in value of a storage slot for a contract. It can be used on a live production network, as well as in conjuntion with sothis (keep in mind that you can use the `--block_listen_time`!) . If you are testing on a local network, you can launch another instance of sothis to track the change of a slot on a replay node.   

The result is saved to a JSON file that looks like this:
```json
{
	"storage_slot":"0x0",
	"state_changes":[
		{"block_number":"0x10b7bbc","value":"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e2b18"}
	]
}
```

#### Usage

- `--mode track`: Used to denote we are using the tracking mode.
- `--source_rpc`: RPC of the node we are getting data from.
- `--contract_address`: Address of the contract we are reading storage from.
- `--storage_slot`: The storage slot of the contract.
- `--filename`(optional): Name of our output file. The default filename is formatted as: `address-{}-slot-{}-timestamp-{}.json`.
- `--path`(optional): Path to our output file. The default path is the current directory.

Once you are done tracking the slot, terminate the process via a `SIGTERM` or a `SIGINT` (ctrl-c), which will terminate execution and write the file.

`sothis --mode track --source_rpc http://localhost:8545 --contract_address 0x1c479675ad559DC151F6Ec7ed3FbF8ceE79582B6 --storage_slot 0 --filename siuuu.json --path ~/Desktop
`

## Installation

Sothis is a rust crate. You can install it with cargo:
`cargo install sothis`

## FAQ

###  Why is sothis so slow?

Sothis uses a lot of JSON-RPC calls. This may cause your RPC provider to throttle you. It's recommended to use your own local node.       
If using `anvil` make sure you add the `--cups {REALL_HIGH_VALUE}` arg so anvil doesn't throttle itself.

### I have a problem with sothis. Can devs do something?

Yes! Make a github issue detailing your problem.

### Why the name?

Sothis is known as the creator and God of FÃ³dlan in Fire Emblem: Thee Houses. She has the ability to rewind time at will.
